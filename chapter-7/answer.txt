#hw7-1
The oplog utilizes a capped collection.
The minimum sensible number of voting nodes to a replica set is three.

#hw7-2
w="majority", j=1

#hw7-3
There must be an index on the collection that starts with the shard key.
Any update that does not contain the shard key will be sent to all shards.
MongoDB cannot enforce unique indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key itself or indexes preferred by the shard key.
